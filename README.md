# Walletudo - Money Manager
Android application that allows you to record your expenses and incomes to present them in a form a report. It also supports a data synchronization between multiple devices by sharing a database file via a Dropbox. Back then I haven't known that I needed a backend application that stores all the data and is responsible for data synchronization. But hey! It was working when used properly.

It is not officially released yet, ~~but soon...~~ and won't ever be.

If you would like to check this application right now, you can download ready apk file from [here](https://github.com/WojciechKo/Walletudo/raw/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk).
